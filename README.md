# Frontend-Architecture-Playground

This repository demonstrates how I structure and think about modern frontend applications, focusing on scalability, UX clarity, and maintainable architecture.

I created this repository to showcase frontend architectural decisions I typically make
while building real-world, data-heavy applications such as trading platforms,
analytics dashboards, and enterprise systems.

This project focuses on:
- Clean project structure
- Scalable component architecture
- Separation of UI, logic, and state
- UX-driven component decisions
- Performance-aware rendering patterns

Tech stack:
- React
- Vite
- JavaScript / TypeScript
- Minimal styling (focus on structure, not visuals)
